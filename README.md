# Galaxy Racers
Recreation of Cloud Racer Game from Neopets

In this game, you play as a spaceship. The goal is for your enemy spaceship to crash before you do! 

I programed this game entirely myself using the pygame library. This was meant as a fun project that would be a recreation of one of my favorite childhood games.

In this code, I utilized: Object Oriented Programming, Functions, Methods, Looping, Logic, and AI programming. The computer will try to avoid a crash, but otherwise pick a random direction to go in, favoring staying on course. 

### Next steps/Wish List:
-Incorporate "smarter" AI that can make optimal choices and not just random choices

-Add difficulty levels: increased velocity, obstacles, smarter AI

-Add ability to pick character in the inital game loading screen

-Add sound effects and toggle if these are on or off when playing game

-Animate clouds forming behind spaceship
